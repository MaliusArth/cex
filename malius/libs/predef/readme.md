This library defines a set of compiler, architecture, operating system, library, and other version numbers from the information it can gather of C, C++ predefined macros or those defined in generally available headers. The idea for this library grew out of a proposal to extend the Boost Config library to provide more, and consistent, information than the feature definitions it supports.
